# Description
This is a custom I made for Tama (https://www.youtube.com/@TamaAzulight).

# Free to edit
Feel free to edit/modify the cursor in any way you want but make sure to credit me in some way.

# Install
For now the only operating sistem that the cursor supports is Windows

# Windows

**1-** First you have to unzip the `Tama cursor.zip` file. For this you can use [7 Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) I recomend 7 Zip but both work. Place the unziped folder in a place you remember. (I recomend the documents folder).

**2-** Search up _change the mouse pointer display or speed_ in Windows start menu (bottom left in win 10 or middle in win 11) and click _change the mouse pointer display or speed_.

**3-** Click _Pointers_.

**4-** Select _cursor type_ and _browse_.

**5-** Go to the folder where you saved the cursors.

**6-** Select the cursor whith the same name as the cursor in the mouse properties `Ex: "base" in the settings and "Tama_base_cursor.ani"`

**7-** Repeat and apply (for the ones that dont have a pair just use the one that makes the most sense)!!

**8-** ENJOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
